    Hitman 3 IGT Tracker (Main Game Mode), Epic Games Version

    This script is based on a version originally created by sandro-h and updated by B3akers, fu5ha, emcifuntik, mob1lity, quatilyti
    (Github usernames of all involved).

    I (Solderq35) claim no credit for contributing to this autosplitter file, I just re-uploaded the most recent versions (with permission)
	to Github for version control purposes.

    This script tracks Hitman 3 ingame time in LiveSplit.
    * It does NOT auto-split
    * It tracks time across levels and level restarts
    * It pauses in menus, including inventory
    * IGT is intended timing method for main game mode speedruns, due to historicity and console inclusion, among other reasons

    Dev note:

    The base pointer offsets likely need to be updated with each game patch. Here's how:

    For each value, a signature is provided above it. In CheatEngine, open hitman3 process and set the
    scan "Value Type" to "Array of byte". Then paste the signature into the Value box and make sure Hex is checked.
    Change the "Writeable" checkbox to be a square rather than a check. Change the "All" dropdown to "hitman3.exe".
    Then press "First Scan".

    It should find a result on the left box. Right click that and choose "Disassemble this memory region".
    In the new window, on the highlighted line, you should see in the "opcode" box, something to the effect
    off:

    mov rcx, [hitman3.exe+<NUMBERS AND LETTERS HERE>]

    The value in <NUMBERS AND LETTERS HERE> is the offset of the static pointer we are looking for. You can insert that
    value for the first offset for the variable in the form 0x<NUMBERS AND LETTERS HERE>.

    The second offset likely will not need to be changed, but if you get weird behavior then it might. To aid yourself,
    you can add values in CheatEngine to view their values directly live.

    On the right side, click "Add Address Manually". In the box that pops up, choose "Float" under the "Type" dropdown, then check "Pointer".
    In the bottom box, enter:

    hitman3.exe + <NUMBERS AND LETTERS HERE>

    then in the box above it, which is the offset, enter the expected offset value. Then click Ok. You can then view the value. Do
    this for each of the three variables. Start the game and observe the behavior. If it doesn't make sense, double click on the "Address" part
    of the values in the bottom table to edit it. Then, edit the offset by clicking the left and right arrows and see if you can find a value
    which restores the expected behavior.

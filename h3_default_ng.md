## Default (NG)
**Brief Explanation on Purpose of Category**: Hitman 3 subtly changes many things from a first to a second playthrough, even down to which starting location is the "default" one (the starting location you get when booting up a level from main menu). 

You can think of Default NG ("New Game") as meaning "Default Settings on a First Playthrough", aiming to only allow gameplay elements possible on a fresh copy of the game. Note that actually playing on a fresh copy of the game is not sustainable for a speedrun due to Epic (among other platforms) not having family sharing available, and it is very hard to reset progress otherwise. Thus, making use of new unlocks along the way (like you might otherwise do in a NG run of other games) is not allowed.

### Loadout
* Unless specified otherwise below (check Additional Rules), bring ICA19/ coins/ fiberwire in starting loadout. If option is not available, bring no loadout
* Any smuggle location in this list (https://rentry.org/h3_no_mastery_smuggles) is allowed
* Starting with briefcase in hand is not allowed, but you are allowed to pick up a briefcase from any of the allowed default smuggle locations above.

### Starting Location
* NG Default start= upper left starting location from planning screen options. The starting location available on the **very first playthrough.** Skydiver start in Dubai for instance.

### Additional Rules
* Persistent shortcuts are allowed only if you approach from the side you would unlock it from, and have the necessary items to unlock it (to simulate NG experience)
* Start no loadout in Miami, Hokkaido, and Berlin
* Choose between starting with either coins or fiberwire for Dubai, but not both
* Can not use elevator exit in Dubai
* Must take scooter exit in Dartmoor (the one near main road starting location)
* Must take "Into the Woods" exit in Berlin
* Must hack data core in Chongqing
* Must approach Diana and trigger the Diana meeting cutscene before killing any target in Mendoza.
* You have the following options for Mendoza NG Exit:
  * Use Diana Dance Floor Exit
  * Wait for Diana's exit symbol to show up, then shoot at Dance Floor to panic her and lock the Dance Floor Exit and unlock other exits (as you would need to on new copy of game)
  * Check that Diana is already on dance floor using Instinct, in which case you can shoot at Dance Floor before the Dance Floor Exit opens. 
* In Colorado, must investigate the 2 clues in the tornado shelter, and then use the tornado exit

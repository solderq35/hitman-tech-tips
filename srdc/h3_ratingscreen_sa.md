## Glitched/ Romania Rating Screen Policy (SA runs)

**All SA or SASO** runs will require a rating screen due to possible discrepancies between SA tracker and rating screen, in terms of rating. Glitched Peacock rating screen is acceptable for this, assuming the rating screen shows "Silent Assassin".

Glitched Peacock rating screen (negative 1:59 time) will result in a second added to the last seen time on the timer HUD for most levels/ exits (to prevent possible cases where the rating screen would have been one second later than the timer HUD time, if the rating screen worked properly).
* Example of timer HUD/ rating screen time discrepancy, and why the +1 second rule is needed: https://youtu.be/NyuerQSLgNU?t=140

Exceptions/ Clarifications to the above rule
- For Romania, if the time on the rating screen matches or is one second later than the last seen time on the timer HUD, use the rating screen time. Otherwise, add one second to the last seen time on timer HUD for the in game time.
  - Note that you can prevent the unskippable syringe cutscene glitch by holding inventory about 5 seconds at the syringe prompt before exiting ([Example](https://youtu.be/qk6z9Pg_Lxg?t=183)).
- For Freeform Training, Final Test, and Paris helicopter exit, go by the last seen time on timer HUD (as these levels exits occur when hitting prompt), in the case of glitched rating screen.

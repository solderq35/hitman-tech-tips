### H3 Standard Category Banned Techniques/ Glitches
* Any trick that is not possible in current Hitman 3 patch is banned (which can result in old submissions being moved to No Longer Possible Category)
* Tranq glitch is banned (shoot target with Kalmer or use other sedative on them, kill with non-accident method right after, keep SA if body found)
* Use of Midnight Suit in Mendoza banned (trespassing permissions are bugged)
* 24 hour in game timer overflow exploit is banned (Example: https://youtu.be/mJyyyYnrXlk?t=1529)
* Server/ disconnect glitch that results in target "death" without actually killing target is banned (Example: https://youtu.be/IZxoUftRYK8)
* Server warp/ teleport (Example: https://youtu.be/cW_8nXhbAHg) is banned on highly competitive individual level categories
* Resolution Stretch Glitch to teleport 47's gun (Example: https://youtu.be/MtBTkY3F4iM?t=14)
  * (This one works since 47 shoots based on where the camera is)

### Disclaimer/ Explanation
**This is not intended to be a "glitchless" nor a "no major glitches" ruleset.** It is banning a few specific glitches deemed harmful to competition by the community, based on community polls and discussion in the past. The reasoning for the banned glitches are given below:
* Old patch tricks are banned because it is very difficult if not impossible to downpatch this game (at least with a rating screen). Ensuring that all records are possible on current patch ensures fair competition.
* [Tranq glitch](https://youtu.be/KFrqJAM6vqI?t=8) is banned due to longstanding community opinion to do so. It is probably the most arbitrary glitch ban listed here.
  *  More in-depth explanation of tranq glitch: Sedate target with Kalmer dart gun/ sedative poison/ goldbrick proximity mine, then kill target with non-accident method and retain Silent Assassin rating even if body is found
  * Many players feel that tranq glitch cheapens the challenge of Silent Assassin too much, as it makes any kill a free Silent Assassin kill as long as you are able to find an angle to shoot the target with the tranq pistol.
  * In any case, tranq glitch is mostly obsolete, only being a potential timesave in Illusions of Grandeur SASO currently. It would have more implications for full-game consistency, if allowed again.
* The Midnight Suit ban are due to the philosophy that all suits should act the same in regards to trespassing
* The timer overflow exploit is banned due to the fact no one wants to watch a 24 hour video
* The server warp is banned for highly competitive categories because it is extremely random/ we don't know what causes it, and will kill competition if part of a WR strategy
* You can't see what the player is doing during the Resolution Stretch Glitch; in order to make the camera move enough, you have to make the resolution ridiculously stretched to the point almost nothing can be seen on screen. This makes it too easy for the player to use cheats while performing this glitch, without being able to see them doing so.

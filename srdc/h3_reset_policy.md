## Reset Policy for Bangkok Default Start and Sgail Chapel Start
  * If the player resets mid-cutscene into the level a +1 second penalty will applied. When at Bangkok Default Start or on a Sarajevo Six level where targets have RNG starting position (This penalty includes resetting after skipping the cutscene and immediately checking the targets position), the reset penalty may be arbitrarily increased (up to +10 seconds penalty) at moderator discretion, if it appears that the player is resetting to farm good cutscene RNG.
    * The rule for Bangkok Riverside Start runs is due to a cutscene exploit where you can tell Jordan cycle RNG based on how he moves in the cutscene, and reset mid-cutscene if there is bad Jordan RNG for zero in-game time penalty.
Example: https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/m3n08pgy
    * The rule for Sarajevo Six is because many of the levels' targets have RNG starting positions, and this can be visible during the cutscene or immediately after skipping the cutscene and opening the map. 

## Reset Policy for runs with game crash or disconnection error
The following cases will result in being able to reset the level with no time penalty, no matter how far you were into the level:
* You get a connection error that forces you back to the main menu, like "could not load the requested menu" (recording must continue to being reconnected)
* Your game crashes (recording must continue through the crash and to the game being reopened)
  * Exception: If you crash/ get connection error that forces you back to main menu, and your successful retry is a lower in game time than when you reset due to a crash/ disconnect, then the time from the crash/ disconnect attempt will be used instead
  * Exception 2: If you crash/ get connection error that forces you back to main menu "coincidentally" after the run was already observed to have low chance of success (e.g. Vanya standing up late in the SASO Mumbai strategy), the in game time of the crash/ disconnect may be added to the total in game time at the moderators' discretion

## Policy for runs with missing Timer HUD
* **If you reset or die during a run, lack of timer HUD will result in automatic rejection**
    * Go to Options > Gameplay > HUD > Mission Timer to turn this setting on

## Policy for runs with glitched or missing rating screen (including Romania syringe unskippable cutscene glitch)
**SA and SASO runs will be rejected if the rating screen is missing.**
* All SA or SASO runs will require a rating screen due to possible discrepancies between SA tracker and rating screen, in terms of rating. Glitched Peacock rating screen is acceptable for this, assuming the rating screen shows "Silent Assassin".

* Glitched Peacock rating screen (negative 1:59 time) will result in a second added to the last seen time on the timer HUD for most levels/ exits (to prevent possible cases where the rating screen would have been one second later, if the rating screen worked properly).

**Any% runs are allowed to not have a rating screen, if the in-game timer is on**. 
* No rating screen for any% runs will result in a second added to the last seen time on the timer HUD for most levels/ exits (to prevent possible cases where the rating screen would have been one second later, if the rating screen worked properly).

Exceptions/ Clarifications to the above rules
- For Mendoza tango exit, add 42 in game seconds to the last time seen on timer HUD if the player did not interrupt the tango, and the rating screen is glitched. If the player used a bomb etc to kill/ stun Diana to end dance early, then the run will be invalid if the rating screen is glitched.
- For Chongqing camera exits, the run will be invalid if the rating screen is glitched (as mis-aiming the camera can delay the exit, and the timer HUD is not visible while camera is being used).
- For Romania, if the time on the rating screen matches or is one second later than the last seen time on the timer HUD, use the rating screen time. Otherwise, add one second to the last seen time on timer HUD for the in game time.
  * Note: You can prevent the unskippable cutscene glitch in most cases, by staying in the inventory menu for a few seconds (at no in-game time penalty), before exiting.

- For Freeform Training, Final Test, and Paris helicopter exit, go by the last seen time on timer HUD (as these two level exits occur when hitting prompt), in the case of glitched rating screen.
